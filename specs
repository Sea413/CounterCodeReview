Test 1

It determines if there is an exact match Input :"like" "like" Output: 1

Test 2
It verifies that two dissimilar terms are not matches Input: "Not" like Output: 0

Test 3

it determines that two terms are the same without case sensitivity Input "like" "Like" Output: 1

(I have found a better approach to resolve the issue not needing this step of the process. Instead of ommitting the spec I have elected to leave it to show revisions have occurred.)


Test 4

Will only record complete matches Input "like and likeness" output: 1

Test 5

Introduces all previous tests, includes partial matches and case sensitivity. Input "Like and likeness and like" Output: 2;
